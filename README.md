## Aalways Running Background Network Monitor Service - Android

This is an example of always running Service in Android

### Explanation

#### Foreground Service:
MyService is set up as a foreground service with a notification, which is necessary for long-running tasks to ensure it’s not killed by the system.
START_STICKY in onStartCommand() ensures that the service will be restarted if it gets killed.

#### Broadcast Receiver:
MyReceiver is used to handle broadcasts that will trigger the MyWorker to check and restart the service.

#### WorkManager:
MyWorker is scheduled to run periodically to check if MyService is running. If it's not running, it starts the service.
The periodic work is scheduled to run every 16 minutes, which is a reasonable frequency considering WorkManager’s minimum interval constraints.

#### Handling Service Restart:
By sending a broadcast to MyReceiver in the onDestroy() method of MyService, the service is requested to restart. MyReceiver then schedules a one-time work request to ensure the service restarts.
MyWorker will periodically check if MyService is running and start it if necessary, providing an additional layer of reliability.


### Considerations

#### Battery Optimization:

Frequent restarts and periodic checks can impact battery life. Ensure that your use case justifies this approach.

#### Service Lifetime Management:
The combination of WorkManager and foreground service helps maintain the service's operation but can be subject to system constraints and optimizations.

#### Permissions:
Ensure that the necessary permissions and settings (such as auto-start permissions) are properly handled and requested from the user if needed.
